# Las-Vegas-Sphere-Database

This is a relational database system based on the Las Vegas Sphere made to demonstrate scalability and normalization concepts in database management. 

The Sphere is a technological phenomenon located in Las Vegas with the ability to showcase a variety of performances in an immersive view. This 10-year in the making project finally premiered with its debut grand opening in September 2023 and quickly rose to national acclaim due to its verbose technological capacity, light, and audio-visual elements. Consisting of different divisions, seat capacity and multiple levels for venues, this architectural marvel is an entertainment hub.
